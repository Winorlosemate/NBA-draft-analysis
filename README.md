#NBA Player Statistics
Using data from NBA seasons 2015-16 to 2017-18, the purpose of this analysis is to determine projections for the 2018-19 season while it is currently still being played. We will then compare the variance of projected to actual yearly statistical outputs to determine the usability and accuracy of the model for future seasons.

We will trial a couple of different statistical time-series models to view which model fits best on the actual output.

As part of my own learning process, I have decided to create a GUI for external users to be able to use as they wish for fantasy basketball (ESPN or Yahoo). The GUI will allow users to project for the following fantasy basketball formats:
- Head to Head Leagues in Yahoo (Standard 9 Category League)
- ESPN Points Leagues
